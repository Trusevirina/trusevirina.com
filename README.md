<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://trusevirina.github.io/trusevirina.com/)

**TRUSEVIRINA.COM** is a personal website created entirely from scratch by Taylor Turner.  
The site serves as a hub for original content, including blog posts, articles, resources, and multimedia creations.  

This project was inspired by the desire to share ideas, experiments in creativity, and carefully curated resources with a wider audience, while maintaining a unique and personal style.  


### Key Features:
- A fully custom-built static website, designed and coded from the ground up  
- Sections for blog posts, news, writing, and downloadable resources  
- Personal portfolio and contact information  
- Original graphics, images, and content fully owned by the author  

The website is designed for visitors interested in creative writing, web design experimentation, and original multimedia content.


### Built With

This website has been crafted entirely from scratch using a combination of standard web technologies:

- **HTML** ‚Äì provides the structural backbone of the site, with all pages saved as `.html` files.  
- **CSS** ‚Äì responsible for the visual design and layout, contained in a single stylesheet (`style.css`) that shapes the site's aesthetic.  
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì used selectively to enhance interactivity, powering small widgets and special functions directly embedded in the `.html` files.  

Every element, from the layout and graphics to the content and interactive features, has been designed and implemented personally by the author.  
This project reflects both creative design choices and careful technical implementation, demonstrating a complete, self-contained approach to building a static website.
